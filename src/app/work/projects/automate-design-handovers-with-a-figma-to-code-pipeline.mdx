## Overview

In this project, my main task was create a game from scratch. My inspiration was The Legend of Zelda, and thats why I developed this short videogame using Javascript

## Key Features

- **Tileset and Map**: I used MapperMate to craft from scratch the full tileset for the videogame map. All th map was created manually.
- **Movement and Collision**: I used Javascript logic to manage the main character movement, attack and the collision detection for the enemies and the chests.
- **Camera centered movement**: I used Javascript and Math logic to manage the camera movement and the following of the main character around the map.
## Technologies Used

- **Javascript**
- **CSS**
- **MapperMate**

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the biggest challenges was create all the logic for the movement of the character, the camera and the chests opening.

## Outcome

I show this project to my teachers and fellow mates and they really loved it.
